# CMI Kaggle Competition Scripts

This repository contain all the scripts we used to organize CMI's actigraphy data to the Kaggle competition that we hosted.

To organize the data, run the scripts in the folowwing order:

1. organize_files.ipynb
   |-> it will organize the "data_cleaning" files from all raters into one single file
   |-> it will organize the "sleep_log" files from all raters into one single file
   |-> it will copy the csv files to a different folder
